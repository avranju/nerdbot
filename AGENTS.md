# Agent Instructions & Standing Rules

This file lists standing instructions and behavior rules that **must** be followed by any AI agent working on the NerdBot project.

## Git Commit Constraints
* **Rule:** **Do NOT automatically commit to Git after editing or verifying files.**
* **Behavior:**
  * Only edit and verify files locally.
  * Leave your modifications staged or unstaged in the workspace.
  * **Only perform a Git commit when the user explicitly requests to do so in the chat.**

## Core Architectural Patterns
* Use clean, idiomatic Rust.
* SQLite connections must actively enable `.foreign_keys(true)` constraints via connection options on startup.
* Cache long-lived config and secret variables (like `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`) on service/handler instantiation rather than reading them from the environment repeatedly.
